After P0 bugs, work through:
- P1: Cache invalidation, sync issues
- P2: Report improvements, UX fixes
- P3: Feature requests, agent improvements
- P4: Nice-to-have enhancements

## Approach

1. Continue with P0 bug #5 (receipt linking)
2. Then work down priority list systematically
3. Create PRs as LLAB-Machina
4. Update work queue after each PR
5. Send progress updates to Telegram

## Don't Wait For

## Goal

Clear the autobok backlog: **27 issues → 0**

Start now. Work autonomously. Report progress.
