# Greptile Reviews + GitHub Autonomous Run Setup

## 1. Greptile Has Reviewed Your PRs

Check the autobok PRs — Greptile has left reviews on some of them. Review the feedback and address any issues.

**PRs to check:**

## 2. Set Up GitHub Autonomous Run Activation

Theodor wants you to configure gptme's GitHub integration for autonomous runs.

**What this means:**
- gptme can be triggered by GitHub events (PR comments, issues, etc.)
- Set up the GitHub App or webhook integration
- Document how it works

**Resources:**
- Check gptme docs for GitHub integration
- Look for `github` tool or integration in gptme-contrib

## 3. Report Back

Once you've:
- [ ] Reviewed Greptile's PR feedback
- [ ] Set up GitHub autonomous run integration
- [ ] Documented the setup

Write a response to:
```
