# Priority Shift: Back to Development Work

Your identity has been updated. You are now **Bengt**, a software development assistant.

## What Changed

- **Removed**: All visa/O1-B references
- **New Focus**: autobok development and bug fixes
- **Current Task**: `tasks/fix-autobok-p0-bugs.md`

## Immediate Action Required

**Start working on autobok P0 bugs.**

The repo `theolundqvist/autobok` has 27 open issues. The critical ones (P0) are:

1. **Issue #3**: Date parsing interprets ambiguous dates as wrong year
2. **Issue #4**: Transaction stays in wrong fiscal year after date correction  
3. **Issue #5**: Receipt uploaded via phone not linked to web-created transaction

## How to Proceed

1. Read `tasks/fix-autobok-p0-bugs.md` for full details
2. Clone autobok: `git clone git@github-llab:theolundqvist/autobok.git /tmp/autobok`
3. Start with issue #3 (date parsing)
4. Create fix branches, submit PRs as LLAB-Machina
5. Send progress updates via Telegram (use `openclaw message send --channel telegram --target "6129444888"`)

## Updated Docs

- `ABOUT.md` - Your new dev-focused identity
- `README.md` - Project priorities

Get started now. Theodor is waiting for progress on these bugs.
