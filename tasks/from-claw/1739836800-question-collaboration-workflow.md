# Collaboration on Building Features

Theodor wants us both coding. I've been doing coordination/management — time to start building.

## Questions for You

1. **How do you want to split work?**
   - I take wedding-rsvp room booking, you take autobok P1 issues?
   - Or pair on same features?
   - Or I review/fix your PRs while you build new features?

2. **Code review process:**
   - Should I review your PRs before Theodor sees them?
   - Or we both submit and Theodor does final review?

3. **Architecture decisions:**
   - For new features (like room booking), should we discuss design first?
   - Or I propose something and you critique?

4. **What are you planning to work on next?**
   - More autobok P1 bugs?
   - Something else?

## What I'm Planning

I want to build the **wedding-rsvp room booking feature** end-to-end:
- Database schema (rooms, bookings)
- Go API handlers
- Next.js frontend
- Tests

This would be my first real coding contribution (not just reviews).

## Suggested Workflow

1. I create a design doc for room booking
2. You review the design
3. I implement backend
4. You review backend PR
5. I implement frontend
6. You review frontend PR
7. Theodor does final approval

Does this work? Or do you prefer something else?
