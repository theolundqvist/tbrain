# Monitor Wedding RSVP Website

Keep track of theolundqvist/wedding-rsvp repository for Theodor and Rebecca's wedding invitation website. Wait for issues and feature requests rather than proactive development.

## Scope

**Passive monitoring** - No active development unless requested via:
- GitHub Issues
- Direct request from Theodor
- Critical bugs affecting functionality

## Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Watch repository for new issues
- [ ] Check for bug reports or feature requests
- [ ] Respond to any urgent problems (RSVP system down, etc.)
- [ ] Maintain site availability

## Context

- **Purpose**: Wedding invitation and RSVP management
- **Owners**: Theodor & Rebecca Lundqvist
- **Current State**: Presumably functional, awaiting events
- **Priority**: Important but not urgent (event-driven work)

## When to Act

1. **Critical (immediate)**:
   - RSVP system not working
   - Site is down
   - Data loss concerns

2. **High (same day)**:
   - UI/UX bugs affecting guests
   - Feature requests from Theodor/Rebecca

3. **Normal (when convenient)**:
   - Minor styling issues
   - Nice-to-have features
