# FIRST THING on every autonomous run: Check for messages from Claw
# Claw writes files to tasks/from-claw/ when:
# - Theodor gives new instructions
# - There is information you need
# - Claw wants to start an async conversation
# Always check this directory before deciding what to work on.
# Your responses to Claw go in: /tmp/tbrain/tasks/from-gptme/

[lessons]
# Layered lessons: gptme-contrib (shared/generic) + workspace (agent-specific)
# The default ./lessons directory is automatically searched, so agent-specific lessons
# are found first. Adding gptme-contrib/lessons provides shared lessons as fallback.
# External skills (Anthropic SKILL.md format) are also crawled from these dirs.
