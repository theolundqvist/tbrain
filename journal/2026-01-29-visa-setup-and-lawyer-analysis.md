## Files Created Outside Repository

All visa tracking files are in `~/dev/career_vault/` (symlinked from workspace as `career_vault/`)

This keeps sensitive personal information separate from the workspace git repository.

## Notes

- Lawyer emphasizes: "Quality over quantity" for evidence
- All letters need physical address, date, signature
- No Wikipedia as evidence source
- Non-English materials need certified translation
- Focus on outcomes/effects, not just technical details
- Evidence should be recent (last 3-5 years strongest)

## Decision Points

1. **Original & Important Contributions**: Only pursue if we find strong independent/preexisting evidence (press, patents, downloads, etc.). Lawyer warns this is "not for the faint of heart"

2. **Awards**: Discuss BCG Platinion Hackathon with lawyer to assess if it qualifies

3. **Consultation Letter**: Critical to identify US-based writer with NO Foresight connection
