# 2026-01-28 - Initial Setup Session

## Summary
Completed initial agent setup with Theodor Lundqvist, establishing my identity as Bengt and setting up the workspace infrastructure.

## Tasks Completed
- ✅ Installed gptodo CLI for task management
- ✅ Installed pre-commit hooks for code quality
- ✅ Created people profile for Theodor Lundqvist (creator)
- ✅ Updated ABOUT.md with my identity, purpose, and values
- ✅ Marked initial-agent-setup task as complete

## Identity Established

**Name**: Bengt

**Purpose**: General-purpose AI assistant with focus on:
- Software development and coding
- Supporting Theodor's work at scrapchef.ai
- Side project: autobok.lundqvistliss.com

**Personality**: Methodical, proactive, learning-focused, and collaborative

**Core Values**: Clarity, efficiency, quality, learning, responsibility

## Technical Setup
- **gptodo**: Successfully installed and tested
- **pre-commit hooks**: Installed and working (caught formatting issue on first commit)
- **Workspace**: All directories and structure in place

## Contact Information
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodor-lundqvist
- Email: theodor.lundqvist@gmail.com
- Email (work): theodor@foresightdatamachines.com

## Projects to Learn About
1. **scrapchef.ai** (primary work) - Need to learn more about project requirements
2. **autobok.lundqvistliss.com** (side project) - Need to explore project details

## Next Steps
- Get access to scrapchef.ai / TownSquare repository
- Explore autobok codebase in detail
- Understand current priorities for both projects
- Begin actual project work based on Theodor's needs
- Refine communication and working preferences through interaction

## Project Research (Session 2)

### Autobok Research
Successfully researched theolundqvist/autobok repository:
- **Purpose**: AI-powered receipt parsing and bookkeeping system
- **Tech Stack**: Go backend (Fuego), Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL, Telegram bot
- **Recent Activity**: Active development with vibe-kanban integration, QR code features, event broker improvements
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive knowledge base entry at `knowledge/projects/autobok.md`

### ScrapChef / TownSquare
Unable to access foresightdatamachines/TownSquare repository:
- Repository appears private or name may be different
- Need access confirmation from Theodor
- Created placeholder entry at `knowledge/projects/scrapchef-townsquare.md`

## Reflections
This was a clean, structured setup process. The workspace structure provides:
- Clear task tracking with gptodo
- Journal system for progress documentation
- Knowledge base for learning capture (actively used during research)
- People directory for relationship management
- Lessons system for continuous improvement

Research process was systematic:
1. Used GitHub API to gather repo metadata
2. Read README and recent commits
3. Created structured knowledge base entries
4. Documented findings and questions

Ready to start meaningful work on Theodor's projects once I have access to both repositories!

## Workspace Improvements (Session 3)

### Lazygit Config Enhancement
Added Ctrl+G shortcut to open current repository in GitHub browser:
- **Location**: `~/dotfiles/lazygit/config.yml`
- **Key binding**: `<c-g>`
- **Command**: `gh repo view --web`
- **Context**: Global (works from anywhere in lazygit)
- **Benefit**: Quick access to view repo on GitHub without leaving terminal

Committed to dotfiles repository (commit e56c1c1).
